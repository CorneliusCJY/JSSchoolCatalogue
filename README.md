## JSSchoolCatalogue
We need to create classes for primary and high schools. Because these classes share properties and methods, each will inherit from a parent School class. Our parent and three child classes have the following properties, getters, setters, and methods:

#School

Properties: name (string), level (one of three strings: 'primary', 'middle', or 'high'), and numberOfStudents (number)
Getters: all properties have getters
Setters: the numberOfStudents property has a setter
Methods: .quickFacts() and .pickSubstituteTeacher() (this is a static method)


#Primary

Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
Properties: pickupPolicy (string)

#Middle

Does not include any additional properties or methods

#High

Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
Properties: sportsTeams (array of strings)
If youâ€™re looking for a challenge, create the constructor() and getters for the four classes above. Then, use the setter and methods specifications in steps five, six, and seven to finish the project.
